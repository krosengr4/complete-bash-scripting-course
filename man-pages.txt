----- MAN PAGES -----
- Man is short for Manual

- Most of the commands used in bash come with a man page
- Similar to documentation for a package in a programming language

- To get a manual for a command, like mkdir, just run: 'man mkdir'
- And of course you can run 'man man' to get the man manual!

- man is great for more than just commands. man has sections that categorize the types of software to get a manual for:

        The sections of the manual are:

           1.   General Commands Manual
           2.   System Calls Manual
           3.   Library Functions Manual
           4.   Kernel Interfaces Manual
           5.   File Formats Manual
           6.   Games Manual
           7.   Miscellaneous Information Manual
           8.   System Manager's Manual
           9.   Kernel Developer's Manual


- There is a man section for library functions (like ls, mkdir, grep...) 
- There is also a 'man' section equivalent that is for commands builtin to bash.
    - history is a builtin bash command.

*** for builtin commands, use 'help' instead of 'man' ***
    - Ex: 'help history' or 'help export'
